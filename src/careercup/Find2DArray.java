 * Given a 2D array of digits, try to find the occurrence of a given 2D pattern of digits. For example, consider the following 2D matrix:

     7283455864
     6731158619
     8988242643
     3839505324

     7053106601
     0834282956
     4607924137

     Assume we need to look for the following 2D pattern:

     950
     384
